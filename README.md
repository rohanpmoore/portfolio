#### By **_Rohan Moore_**

## Description

_This is my portfolio, which will eventually be shown to potential employers once I have more projects and start searching for jobs.  Quite a few sections will be replaced to be more professional at the time, including this part of the README._

## Setup/Installation Instructions

* _Clone this project from its [Github repository](https://github.com/rohanpmoore/portfolio)._

_Alternatively, you can visit the GH-Pages version of the website [here](https://rohanpmoore.github.io/portfolio/).  This version has a bugged background, but otherwise is identical._

## Existing Bugs

* _The GH-Pages version of the site appears to have a bugged background, maintaining the background from several commits previous._
