        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><em>Rohan Moore</em> is a 21-year-old aspiring programmer at Epicodus learning Ruby and React.  He previously had some experience with programming in high school in C++ and Java, and spent several years working food service before enterring the program.  His hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, tactical video games, and chilling with his friends.  His family pet is a Labrador Retriever named Karma, who supports him with lots of affection.</p>
        <h4>Where I Come From</h4>
        <p>I moved to Portland in 2008 from Las Vegas, before that living in Richmond, Virginia for about ten years.  I attended Jesuit High School in Portland and spent time in Santa Clara, CA and Madison, WI before returning to Portland to work.  I have spent the last few years in food service, primarily at McDonalds, and am now looking to move forward with my education and enter into programming, which has long been a desire of mine.</p>
        <h4>Programming Background</h4>
        <p>My first introduction to programming was a C++ intro to programming class at Portland State University between my sophomore and junior years of high school.  My senior year, I took my high school's programming class, which taught Java with a focus on back end programming.  Over the years I have also created game mods for the game Dwarf Fortress and multiple projects at Epicodus.</p>
